# GolaEV Website Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Changes

### 🧹 **Code Cleanup & Structure**
- ✅ Removed unused imports (`Image` from page.tsx, `useEffect` from ContactPopup)
- ✅ Fixed ESLint errors (escaped apostrophes and quotes)
- ✅ Cleaned up `.next` build directory (reduced from 100+ files to fresh build)
- ✅ Organized import statements consistently

### 🖼️ **Image Optimization**
- ✅ Replaced all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components for better performance
- ✅ Added proper `fill`, `sizes`, and `priority` props for optimal loading
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading by default for all images
- ✅ Added responsive image sizing with `sizes` attribute
- ✅ Created `OptimizedImage` component with error handling and fallback support

### ⚡ **Performance Enhancements**
- ✅ Implemented async/await patterns in `useContactPopup` hook
- ✅ Added throttling to scroll event handlers (60fps optimization)
- ✅ Created performance utilities (`/src/utils/performance.ts`) with:
  - Debounce and throttle functions
  - Async retry mechanisms
  - Safe localStorage/sessionStorage operations
  - Intersection Observer utilities
  - Memory cleanup helpers

### 🔧 **Component Optimizations**
- ✅ Added `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for storage operations
- ✅ Added passive event listeners for better scroll performance
- ✅ Created reusable performance utilities

### 🗂️ **File Structure Improvements**
- ✅ Added dedicated `/src/utils/` directory for utility functions
- ✅ Created modular components for better maintainability
- ✅ Removed unnecessary build artifacts

### 📊 **Build Performance**
- ✅ Build time improved significantly (faster compilation)
- ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ Proper TypeScript integration maintained
- ✅ All images now properly optimized by Next.js

## New Files Added
1. `/src/components/OptimizedImage.tsx` - Advanced image component with error handling
2. `/src/utils/performance.ts` - Performance utility functions

## Key Performance Benefits
- **Faster Initial Load**: Optimized images with lazy loading
- **Better UX**: Smooth scrolling with throttled event handlers  
- **Error Resilience**: Safe storage operations with fallbacks
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper event listener cleanup
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper image optimization and loading

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Modern browsers with full feature support
- ✅ Graceful degradation for older browsers
- ✅ SSR/SSG compatible

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Consider implementing image placeholder/skeleton loading
2. Add service worker for offline functionality
3. Implement bundle analysis for further size reduction
4. Consider lazy loading for non-critical components
